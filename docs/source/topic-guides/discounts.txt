Discounts
=========

Setting up discount codes is a quick and painless process which can be applied to events, memberships, job postings and other places within Tendenci.


Enable discounts
----------------

Discounts come enabled by default, but check at /full-settings TODO to ensure they are current set to 'enabled'


Configure discountable apps
---------------------------

Next configure the apps you would like to have discounts apply to - examples for those mentioned in the introduction are included below.

Memberships
^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure the "Discount eligible" is ticked on the relevant memberships applications (ex: https://www.example.com/admin/memberships/membershipapp/1/).

Adding discount codes
--------------------

Once the applications are configured to allow discounts they will appear in the 'Applications' list when issuing a discount code via https://www.example.com/discounts/add/ .
