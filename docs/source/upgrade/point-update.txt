Performing a minor update
=========================

When a minor update comes out the following steps will upgrade tendenci and its dependencies
::

    pip install tendenci --upgrade
    python deploy.py

If dependencies need to be upgraded at the same time run pip against the requirements file.
::

    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    python deploy.py

To ensure no stale data is carried over in caches between versions clear the application cache and restart.
::

    python manage.py clear_cache
    service tendenci restart
