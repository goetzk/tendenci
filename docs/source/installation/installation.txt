The setup process is broken into three sections.  The first section covers required setup needed in
all cases.  The second section covers optional additional setup for development purposes.  The third
section covers recommended but optional setup to prepare for running a live site.
Steps required for testing are documented separately.


Basic Setup
===========

If you are new to Tendenci, we recommend you setup a copy on your local system before attempting to
install on public hosting.  This will allow you to experiment with the setup process, with Tendenci
itself, with your site design/layout, and with themes before building a real site.  We strongly
recommend installing Tendenci within a virtual environment, which will enable you to install/run Ubuntu within your existing OS,
and will also make it easy to setup/test/discard multiple copies/configurations of Tendenci.


System Requirements
-------------------

These instructions cover the installation of Tendenci on a system running Ubuntu 18.04.

It should technically be possible to install Tendenci on nearly any Linux, Mac, or Windows system,
and some partial instructions for installing on macOS are included below.  However, we generally
recommend installing Tendenci on Ubuntu, and this process has only been thoroughly tested and
documented on Ubuntu.

For testing purposes, we recommend using a virtual machine with at least:

* 2 CPU cores
* 3GB of RAM
* 6GB of storage

If necessary, you may be able to run Tendenci on a VM with as little as 1 CPU core, 2GB of RAM, and
3GB of storage, but you will likely find that to be too slow/constrained even for testing purposes.


System Preparation
------------------

Make sure Ubuntu is up to date before beginning:
::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Also ensure that Ubuntu is configured to automatically install security updates:
::

    sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades update-notifier-common
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades

Install the required system dependencies:
::

    sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv \
      build-essential python3-dev libevent-dev libpq-dev \
      libjpeg8 libjpeg-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev


System Preparation on macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for images to correctly render, you will need to install the jpeg libraries:
::

    curl -O http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz
    cd jpeg-9
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To remove the files
::

    cd ..
    rm -r jpeg-9
    rm jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz

You will also need Xcode 4.4.1 or higher (in the app store) and will need
to install the Command Line tools it comes with. To install these, open Xcode, click the "Xcode"
menu item in the top left of the screen near the Apple logo, then click "Preferences", then click
"Downloads". Then click install on the line next to Command Line Tools.

Database Preparation
--------------------

Tendenci is designed for use with PostgreSQL.

It may be technically possible to use Tendenci with other databases, but Tendenci has only been
tested with PostgreSQL and is not expected to work with other databases without some significant
development effort.

Install PostgreSQL and some required modules:
::

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis

Create a user and database for Tendenci in PostgreSQL (Replace ``DB_USER``, ``DB_PASS`` and
``DB_NAME`` with an appropriate user name, password, and database name):
::

    sudo -u postgres -s
    DB_USER=tendenci
    DB_PASS=tendenci
    DB_NAME=tendenci
    psql -c "CREATE USER $DB_USER WITH PASSWORD '$DB_PASS';"
    psql -c "ALTER ROLE $DB_USER SET client_encoding TO 'UTF8';"
    psql -c "ALTER ROLE $DB_USER SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';"
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE $DB_NAME WITH OWNER $DB_USER;"
    psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE $DB_NAME TO $DB_USER;"
    psql -d $DB_NAME -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
    psql -d $DB_NAME -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;"
    psql -d $DB_NAME -c "CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;"
    psql -d $DB_NAME -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;"

Database Preparation on macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install PostgreSQL on macOS, we recommend using `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com/>`_

If you would like a database GUI, we recommend `PGAdmin <http://www.pgadmin.org/>`_

The commands shown above for creating the database and user on Ubuntu should also work on macOS.


Virtualenv Preparation
----------------------

Virtualenv enables a complete Python environment to be stored within a single directory, which helps
keep the system clean, and makes it easy to run multiple versions of Python, Python libraries, or
Tendenci within a single VM or server.  While not strictly required, we recommend using virtualenv
with Tendenci.

Prepare a virtualenv for Tendenci:
::

    sudo mkdir -p /srv
    sudo chown "$(id -u -n)" /srv/
    cd /srv/
    python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 tendenci
    sudo chown root /srv/

To use the virtualenv, you must "activate" it:
::

    source /srv/tendenci/bin/activate

You can "deactivate" the virtualenv using:
::

    deactivate

Activating the virtualenv adjusts your ``$PATH`` so that running ``python``, ``pip``, or other
commands will run the versions in the virtualenv instead of the versions installed in the base
system.

The ``pip`` in the virtualenv automatically installs Python libraries into the virtualenv without
modifying the base system.  The ``python`` in the virtualenv automatically uses the Python libraries
within the virtualenv instead of any system-level libraries.

Note that you must "activate" the virtualenv every time you open a new terminal or SSH session.  If
your command prompt does not begin with ``(tendenci)``, then you have not activated the
virtualenv, and any ``python`` or ``pip`` commands you run will use the system versions of those
commands instead of the virtualenv versions, which may have unexpected results.

Virtualenv on macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prepare a virtualenv for Tendenci:
::

    virtualenv -p venv

If you have anaconda installed on your machine, you must specify the path to the version of Python
that you would like to use:
::

    virtualenv -p /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3 venv

The commands shown above for activating/deactivating the virtualenv on Ubuntu should also work on
macOS.


Tendenci Installation
---------------------

If you have not already activated your virtualenv, make sure you do so before continuing:
::

    source /srv/tendenci/bin/activate

Install Django:
::

    pip install "Django>=1.11,<2.0"

Create a new Django project based on the Tendenci template:
::

    sudo chown "$(id -u -n)" /var/www/
    cd /var/www/
    django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci-project-template/archive/tendenci11.zip tendenci
    sudo chown root /var/www/

Set up some directories appropriately:
::

    chmod -R -x+X /var/www/tendenci/media/
    mkdir /var/www/tendenci/whoosh_index
    sudo mkdir /var/log/tendenci
    sudo chown "$(id -u -n)": /var/log/tendenci/

Install Tendenci and its dependencies:
::

    cd /var/www/tendenci/
    pip install --no-binary psycopg2 -r requirements/dev.txt --upgrade


Tendenci Configuration
----------------------

Edit ``/var/www/tendenci/conf/settings.py``

For testing, uncomment ``DEBUG = True``

Set ``SECRET_KEY`` and ``SITE_SETTINGS_KEY`` to two different random strings, each at least 50
characters in length.  Random strings are conveniently available at
<https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm> (Use the "63 random alpha-numeric characters" string, and
refresh the page to get an additional string.)

For live sites, set ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` appropriately.  For testing, the default should be
sufficient.

Configure the database settings using the user name, password, and database name you configured in
the "Database Preparation" section above.

Set ``TIME_ZONE`` to the local time zone configured on the system running Tendenci.


Tendenci Preparation
--------------------

Initialize the database and static files:
::

    cd /var/www/tendenci/
    python manage.py initial_migrate
    python manage.py deploy
    chmod -R -x+X /var/www/tendenci/media/
    python manage.py load_tendenci2018_defaults

Set the "Site URL" setting appropriately:
::

    python manage.py set_setting site global siteurl 'https://www.example.com'

Create an administrator login in Tendenci:
::

    python manage.py createsuperuser

To change the theme (optional):
::

    python manage.py set_theme <theme name>


Testing
-------

Start Tendenci:
::

    source /srv/tendenci/bin/activate
    cd /var/www/tendenci/
    python manage.py runserver

Then open ``http://localhost:8000/`` in your browser to see your Tendenci site!

Hit ``CTRL-C`` to exit from ``python manage.py runserver``

If you only plan to use this Tendenci installation for demonstration / testing purposes, you can
stop here.  If you intend to do development or run a live site, continue with one of the next two
sections.


Development Setup
=================

This section covers additional recommended setup if you plan to do development work on Tendenci
itself.

Install and configure git (replace the name and email with appropriate values):
::

    sudo apt-get install git
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"

.. note:: See `this Github help article <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ for instructions.

Clone the Tendenci repository:
::

    cd /srv/
    git clone https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci.git tendenci-git

Edit ``/var/www/tendenci/requirements/tendenci.txt`` and comment out ``tendenci>=8,<9``

Edit ``/var/www/tendenci/requirements/common.txt`` and add:
::

    -e /srv/tendenci-git/

Run ``pip install`` again:
::

    source /srv/tendenci/bin/activate
    cd /var/www/tendenci/
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt --upgrade

Apply any database and static media updates that are in the development version of Tendenci but are
not yet in the released version of Tendenci:
::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py deploy

You can now edit files under /srv/tendenci-git/ and/or run ``git pull`` to retrieve the latest
changes from GitHub.  ``python manage.py runserver`` should immediately pick up your changes, so you
can view them simply by reloading the page in your browser.


Live Site Setup
===============

This section covers additional recommended setup to prepare for running a live site.

You may want to check the
`Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#postgresql-notes>`_
and
`PostgreSQL documentation <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server>`_
for database configuration/tuning suggestions.


Additional Configuration
------------------------

Review the comments and examples in ``/var/www/tendenci/conf/settings.py`` to determine if any
additional settings should be configured for your live site.


How far will it scale?
----------------------

But first, how far will Tendenci scale?

Scalability is one of Tendenci's strengths, with memory as your limit. t2
instances at AWS scale, Linode (or similar) offer the best economics for
clients with fewer than 10k active users.

There are Tendenci installations with significantly over 100k active users.
Those usually self host (for example regulatory reasons) but you should have no
problem whatsoever with fewer than 100k users on a large VM with a lot of RAM.

Once you cross 100k people, deployments will almost certainly need a
combination of multiple front end servers, central authentication, and a
cluster database.


Additional Installation
-----------------------

Install additional system dependencies:
::

    sudo apt-get install nginx memcached libmemcached-dev

Install additional Python dependencies:
::

    source /srv/tendenci/bin/activate
    cd /var/www/tendenci/
    pip install -r requirements/prod.txt --upgrade


Permissions
-----------

When using the Systemd configuration below, Tendenci will run as the ``www-data`` user.  To ensure
that Tendenci has appropriate permissions when running as ``www-data``:
::

    chmod -R o+rX /srv/tendenci/
    sudo chgrp -Rh www-data /var/www/tendenci/
    chmod -R g+rwX /var/www/tendenci/media/ /var/www/tendenci/themes/
    chmod -R g+rwX /var/www/tendenci/whoosh_index/
    sudo chown -Rh www-data /var/log/tendenci/
    chmod -R g+rwX /var/log/tendenci/

For security, you should also ensure that there are no unnecessary permissions:
::

    # Owner/group on /srv/tendenci/ should already be your normal user account
    # Tendenci needs read/search/execute but not write
    chmod -R o+rX-w /srv/tendenci/
    # Owner on /var/www/tendenci/ should already be your normal user account,
    # group should be www-data
    # Tendenci needs read/search but not execute, write is only needed on media, themes, and
    # whoosh_index, other users do not need any access
    sudo chgrp -Rh www-data /var/www/tendenci/
    chmod -R -x+X,g-w,o-rwx /var/www/tendenci/
    chmod -R ug-x+rwX,o-rwx /var/www/tendenci/media/ /var/www/tendenci/themes/
    chmod -R ug-x+rwX,o-rwx /var/www/tendenci/whoosh_index/
    # Owner on /var/log/tendenci/ should be www-data,
    # group should be some group that includes your normal user account but not other inappropriate
    # users (Ubuntu creates a dedicated group for each user by default, so this command uses that)
    # Tendenci and the assigned group need read/write/search but not execute, other users do not
    # need any access (The assigned group needs write access so your normal user account can run
    # `python manage.py ...`)
    sudo chown -Rh www-data:"$(id -u -n)" /var/log/tendenci/
    sudo chmod -R -x+X,g+rw,o-rwx /var/log/tendenci/

Note that these permissions should allow your normal user account to manage/upgrade Tendenci without
using sudo, which is safer than performing management/upgrades using sudo.


Systemd Setup
-------------

Systemd Unit files should be created in ``/etc/systemd/system/`` with a name of
your choice (eg ``tendenci.service``). The contents of your unit file should
look like this:
::

    [Unit]
    Description=Start Tendenci instance
    Requires=nginx.service postgresql.service
    Wants=memcached.service
    Before=nginx.service
    After=postgresql.service

    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/var/www/tendenci
    PIDFile=/run/tendenci.pid
    Type=forking
    KillMode=process
    Restart=on-failure
    ExecStart=/srv/tendenci/bin/gunicorn                    \
              --user www-data                               \
              --group www-data                              \
              --workers 4                                   \
              --bind=127.0.0.1:8000                         \
              --pid=/run/tendenci.pid                       \
              --pythonpath=/var/www/tendenci                \
              --access-logfile=/var/log/tendenci/access.log \
              --error-logfile=/var/log/tendenci/server.log  \
              --capture-output                              \
              --daemon                                      \
             conf.wsgi

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

To start the service manually:
::

    sudo systemctl start tendenci

To start the service automatically on boot:
::

    sudo systemctl enable tendenci


logrotate Setup
---------------

Create ``/etc/logrotate.d/tendenci`` containing:
::

    /var/log/tendenci/*.log {
      daily
      minsize 100k
      missingok
      rotate 14
      compress
      create 0660 www-data www-data
      sharedscripts
      postrotate
        service tendenci restart
      endscript
    }

To ensure that the log files remain readable/writable by your normal user account, change the second
`www-data` in `create 0660 www-data www-data` to a group that includes your normal user account but
not other inappropriate users (Ubuntu creates a dedicated group for each user by default with the
same name as the associated user, so you can use that here).


NGINX Setup
-----------

First, make an NGINX configuration file for the site. This will be created at
``/etc/nginx/sites-available/tendenci`` and should look like this:
::

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        charset utf-8;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        client_max_body_size 30M;
        gzip_types text/css application/javascript text/javascript text/plain text/xml application/xml;
        gzip_vary on;

        root /var/www/tendenci/;

        location /static/ {
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }

        location /media/ {
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }

        location ^~ /media/export/ {
            return 404;
        }

        location ~ /themes/([a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]+)/(media|static)/ {
            access_log off;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        }
    }

Be sure to update the ``server_name`` domain name and ``root`` path appropriately.

Next, create a symlink to the new file and remove the default symlink:
::

    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/tendenci /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tendenci
    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Finally, restart the NGINX service:
::

    sudo service nginx restart


EMail Setup
-----------

For a mail server, install postfix:
::

    sudo apt-get install postfix

During installation, you will see 3 prompts which you must respond to in order to complete the
installation. If the server is already configured with a domain name, enter that domain in the
prompts. Otherwise, leave the defaults in place.


memcached Setup
---------------

memcached is a service that can be used to speed up access to web pages by caching them in the
systems memory for future use.

Tendenci is configured to use memcache automatically once it is installed as described in the
"Additional Installation" section above.

If you wish you increase the amount of memory memcache uses, edit ``/etc/memcached.conf`` and
change the "-m" value from 64 to your desired cache size in MB.


Cron Setup
----------

Tendenci has two management commands that should be run on a regular basis.

``run_nightly_commands`` is used to handle tasks like membership notices, event reminders, and
periodic cleanup.

``process_unindexed`` handles search indexing.

Run ``sudo -u www-data crontab -e`` and add the following lines:
::

    30   2 * * * /srv/tendenci/bin/python /var/www/tendenci/manage.py run_nightly_commands
    */60 * * * * /srv/tendenci/bin/python /var/www/tendenci/manage.py process_unindexed


Multiple Sites
--------------

To install multiple sites on a single server:

* Create a unique user and database in PostgreSQL for each site.
* A unique virtualenv may optionally be created for each site, but is not required.  If using
  multiple virtualenvs, be sure to source the correct virtualenv before running any ``python`` or
  ``pip`` commands.
* You can skip the ``pip install "Django"`` command, but otherwise follow the
  "Tendenci Installation", "Tendenci Configuration", and "Tendenci Preparation" steps above.
  Change the last parameter of the ``django-admin.py startproject ...`` command to create a
  different ``/var/www/<project>/`` directory for each site, then change ``/var/www/tendenci/`` in
  all of the commands in the instructions to work with the appropriate site.
* Configure an additional Systemd Unit file and NGINX configuration file for each site, and
  configure additional cron jobs for each site.  Each site will need to run on a different port
  internally, so change ``8000`` in the example Systemd and NGINX configurations to a unique port
  number for each site.  Also change the names of any log files in the configuration.
* A separate memcached instance for each Tendenci site may optionally be used, but is not required.
